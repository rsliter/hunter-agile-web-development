Group slack: #general in [Hunter College Agile Dev](https://huntercollegeagiledev.slack.com/)  Slack channel

## Objective
Help college seniors to experience agile engineering by simulating a real world environment where engineers build out iterations on features, commit code to Github, learn about how teams operate, and deliver a working product.

## Specific Goals for this Course
* Students will learn about agile project management methodologies including planning and estimation;
* Students will learn about modern software development practices, including Automated Testing and Pair Programming;
* Students will acquire knowledge of collaborative implementation techniques including Pair Programming, Version Control, Continuous Integration, and Documentation;
* Students will deliver working software by the end of the semester.

## Required Readings
eXtreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, 2nd Edition

## Language
All code will be written in Python using the Flask programming framework.

## Method of Evaluation
This is a project-based course. Each student’s contributions will be graded throughout the semester according to the following:

* 50%: code contributions - although this is a group project, we will be periodically checking Github to ensure each teammate is contributing a fair amount;
* 30%: requirements achieved for each version of the coding project (3 versions due);
* 15%: strength of demos delivered throughout project;
* 5%: participation in retrospectives (graded through notes).

For more information on expectations for these deliverables, see the [Rubrics page](RUBRICS.md).

## Course Calendar
The adjunct lecturers will deliver a talk on a particular topic at the beginning of each class. AllThe project deliverables are due at the beginning of the following class, so we ask for your active attention and engagement in lectures. For details on each project deliverable, see [this page](RUBRICS.md).

Notes from each class will also be posted to this repository after each class session.
